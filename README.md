### A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits

##The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git

###Stage is a sort of showcase area in git, where the contents to be committed are placed(just to understand). Staging is done by using git add command
