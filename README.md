REPOSITORY

a central place where data is stored and maintained. A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network.

MERGE

The "merge" command is used to integrate changes from another branch.
The target of this integration (i.e. the branch that receives changes) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch.


COMMIT

In Git, commit is the term used for saving changes.
Git does not add changes to a commit automatically. You need to indicate which file and changes need to be saved before running the Git commit command.
The commit command does not save changes in remote servers, only in the local repository of Git.
